         "description":"In 2018, my journey in computer science and robotics reached its pinnacle as I received a prestigious decoration for my exceptional achievements in high school. This recognition honored my unwavering dedication and ingenuity in these fields. Two groundbreaking projects played a central role in earning this recognition. \n\nThe first project was an impressive rover, inspired by NASA's Mars Rover and crafted meticulously using Arduino. Equipped with a versatile arm controlled remotely through a user-friendly mobile application developed with MIT App Inventor, the rover demonstrated its ability to pick up rocks and objects, navigating and exploring its surroundings with precision. \n\nThe second project that contributed to my reputation was a remarkable robotic hand resembling a prosthetic device. Utilizing the power of Arduino and an innovative mobile application, I designed a sophisticated mechanism that allowed the hand to open and close. This creation exemplified my commitment to improving lives through technology, empowering individuals with limb impairments to regain dexterity and independence by controlling the hand through intuitive gestures on the app."

         "description":"In 2020, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey and successfully created and launched my first startup, called Fluppy. Fluppy was a mobile application available for both iOS and Android platforms, catering to the needs of dog and cat owners. The app offered a wide range of products and services, including food, medicine, toys, and veterinary care, specifically tailored to enhance the well-being of pets. Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, Fluppy managed to gain traction, attracting approximately 1000 downloads on both app stores.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the economic crisis exacerbated by the pandemic, we faced difficulties sustaining the startup, leading to the decision to close the project. However, the story of Fluppy didn't end there. In a strategic move, we sold the code of the application to a foreign company.\n\nDuring this eventful year, I also had the opportunity to participate in the prestigious entrepreneurship camp, Javeriana Territorio Emprendedor, organized by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. The camp provided a platform for aspiring entrepreneurs to showcase their innovative ideas and business models. I was thrilled to secure the first place, recognized for the most influential potential, further validating the viability and impact of my entrepreneurial endeavors."
